# Writrs.
## Web Application Project by: Aysia Brown
### Version: 1.0 (in development)

### Project Overview & Mission:
Writrs is a writing tool designed for writers by writers; it's a place to collect and organize your story ideas whether you are a novelist, a roleplayer, or just a casual writer. 

Writrs solves the pain point of giving writers a starting point to collect and form their ideas. Often times, starting is the hardest part and Writrs intends to make that easier with our collection of character prompts, worldbuilding prompts, and writing prompts to help jumpstart your imagination. The best part of all is that everything is organized in one place, exactly where you need it when you need it. 


### Feature Tasks:
- Authentication (using Firebase email/password auth)
- Public Vs Protected Routes
    - **Public Routes:** Login, Register, Splash Page
